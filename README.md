Feel free to reach out to me for questions.
this is an anemic domain model the design aint best practice, since the UI should be seperate than the Domain , however, showcasing how to build a basic API become Rest API should be modeled, Unit tests, Acceptance Tests, many libraries, i still recommend Dapper with stored procedure for querying, also fluent validation for validating domain models.
