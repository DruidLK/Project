this is an anemic domain model the design aint best practice, since the UI should be seperate than the Domain , however,basic Rest API , Unit tests, Acceptance Tests, many libraries, CI pipeline , i still recommend Dapper with stored procedure for querying, also fluent validation for validating domain models.

Externals can be Databases/Clouds/Other APIs/ Etcs
N-Tier Architecture (Loosly Coupled System Scalling Horizontally, they can be split independantly to microservices the services)
